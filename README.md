## ✨ Key Features
- **Triple-Pane Workspace**: A fluid layout with a Command Center sidebar, a generative Nexus Chat interface, and a dynamic Artifact Foundry panel.
- **Real-Time Conversational AI**: Streaming chat with rich markdown rendering, multi-modal support (STT/TTS), and intelligent tool usage.
- **Artifact Rendering**: A dedicated panel for code previews, live HTML rendering, SVG, and interactive canvas artifacts generated by the AI.
- **MCP Tool Integration**: Dynamically connect to remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for extensible, real-time tool discovery and execution.
- **Cloudflare-Native Tooling**: Simulated tools for deploying Workers, managing R2 files, and querying D1 databases, demonstrating deep integration with the Cloudflare ecosystem.
- **Advanced Session Management**: Persistent chat history via Durable Objects, with intuitive controls for creating, renaming, and deleting sessions.
- **Cyberpunk UI**: A stunning interface featuring glassmorphism effects, smooth animations (Framer Motion), and a fully responsive design.
- **File & Knowledge Management**: Upload files to a session's context, perform semantic searches, and manage your knowledge base through a sleek interface.
> **Note**: The AI capabilities of this application are rate-limited on shared servers. For production use, it is highly recommended to configure your own Cloudflare AI Gateway for optimal performance and reliability.
## 🚀 Quick Start
1.  **Clone & Install**:

## 🔧 Configuration
### Environment Variables
All backend configurations are managed within `wrangler.jsonc`. For production, use Wrangler secrets.
| Variable           | Description                                                              | Required |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| `CF_AI_BASE_URL`   | Your Cloudflare AI Gateway endpoint URL.                                 | **Yes**  |
| `CF_AI_API_KEY`    | Your Cloudflare API key for the AI Gateway.                              | **Yes**  |
| `SERPAPI_KEY`      | (Optional) API key for SerpApi to enable live web search.                | No       |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`| (Optional) API key for OpenRouter integration.                           | No       |
To set a secret for production:
```bash
wrangler secret put CF_AI_API_KEY
```
### In-App Settings

## 💡 Troubleshooting
<details>
  <summary><strong>"Speech recognition is not supported" error</strong></summary>
  <p>This feature relies on the Web Speech API, which is not available in all browsers (e.g., Firefox). For the best experience, please use a Chromium-based browser like Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Microphone access is denied</strong></summary>
  <p>If you see an error about microphone permissions, you need to grant access in your browser's site settings. Click the lock icon in the address bar and ensure "Microphone" is set to "Allow" for this site.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>AI responses are slow or fail</strong></summary>
  <p>This can be due to rate limits on the shared AI Gateway. For consistent performance, configure your own Cloudflare AI Gateway in `wrangler.jsonc`. If the issue persists, check the status of your configured AI model provider.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Failed to add/remove MCP Server</strong></summary>
  <p>Ensure the Worker is running and accessible. Check the Worker logs (`wrangler tail`) for any errors related to Durable Object storage or network requests.</p>
</details>
